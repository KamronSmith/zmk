### twobytwo2

This is an experimental setup on two breadboards, each run by a Nice!Nano v2 with a 3.7V Lipo battery connected to BAT
and GND of the Nice!Nano, a button between GND and RST, and with a 2x2 diode matrix with rows GPIO 15 and 14, diodes
from rows to columns and columns GPIO 16 and 10 (left) or GPIO 10 and 16 (right). The right half is the master.

The bluetooth name of all these breadboard tests is "Two By Two".
